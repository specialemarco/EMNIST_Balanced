EMNIST Balanced Dataset CNN 

Overview

This repository contains a Colab notebook where we explore and improve Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models using the EMNIST Balanced dataset. The EMNIST Balanced dataset is a collection of handwritten characters that are balanced across various classes, making it suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models, particularly for character recognition tasks.
